3,"How long does it take 1 carpenter to make 1 chair, if it takes 5 carpenters 5 days to make 5 chairs?",[5 days],5.0,[95],2411,131,241,"Reasoning:   1. Start by examining what we know from the given information: 5 carpenters take 5 days to make 5 chairs.  2. From this, we can deduce that one group of 5 carpenters working for 5 days results in 5 chairs made. This suggests a linear relationship between carpenters, days worked, and chairs produced.  3. If we consider the work done per day by a single carpenter, we need to find out how many chairs one carpenter can produce in one day. Since 5 carpenters make 5 chairs in 5 days, we can infer that collectively they produce 1 chair per day.  4. Given that the group produces 1 chair per day, we can then deduce that each individual carpenter would also produce 1/5 of a chair per day because the work is evenly distributed among all carpenters.  5.

This means that the total amount of work done is equivalent to \(40 \text{ people} \times 40 \text{ weeks} = 1600 \text{ person-weeks}\).    2. **Calculate the work per pair of socks**: Since 1600 person-weeks produce 40 pairs of socks, the work required to knit one pair of socks is \( \frac{1600 \text{ person-weeks}}{40 \text{ pairs}} = 40 \text{ person-weeks/pair}\).    3. **Apply the work per pair to the new condition**: Now we need to find out how long it will take 30 people to knit 30 pairs of socks.

If 80 bakers can bake 80 cakes in 80 hours, we can deduce the rate at which they bake.    1.

Now, determine the rate of baking per baker per hour.     - Since all 80 bakers together baked 80 cakes in 80 hours, the combined effort per hour is 1 cake per hour (80 cakes / 80 hours).     - Therefore, each baker's individual rate of baking is 1/80 of a cake per hour (1 cake / (80 bakers * 80 hours) = 1/6400 cakes per baker per hour, but since all bakers are equally efficient, we simplify this to 1/80 cakes per hour).    3. With this rate, we can now determine how long it would take for 20 bakers to bake 20 cakes.     - If one baker can bake 1/80 of a cake per hour, then 20 bakers can bake 20/80 of a cake per hour.     - Simplifying, 20 bakers can bake 1/4 of a cake per hour (20/80 = 1/4).    4.

First, calculate the total baking capacity of the 80 bakers over 80 hours.    - Total cakes baked = 80 cakes    - Total bakers = 80    - Total hours = 80  2. Now, determine the rate of baking per baker per hour.    - Since all 80 bakers together baked 80 cakes in 80 hours, the combined effort per hour is 1 cake per hour (80 cakes / 80 hours).    - Therefore, each baker's individual rate of baking is 1/80 of a cake per hour (1 cake / (80 bakers * 80 hours) = 1/6400 cakes per baker per hour, but since all bakers are equally efficient, we simplify this to 1/80 cakes per hour).  3. With this rate, we can now determine how long it would take for 20 bakers to bake 20 cakes.    - If one baker can bake 1/80 of a cake per hour, then 20 bakers can bake 20/80 of a cake per hour.    - Simplifying, 20 bakers can bake 1/4 of a cake per hour (20/80 = 1/4).  4. To find out how long it takes for 20 bakers to bake 20 cakes, we need to divide the total number of cakes by the rate at which 20 bakers bake.    - Time required = Total cakes / Rate of baking    - Time required = 20 cakes / (1/4 cakes per hour) = 20 * 4 = 80 hours.

29,"How long does it take 20 tailors to make 20 dresses, if it takes 50 tailors 50 hours to make 50 dresses?",25 hours,50.0,100,9127,135,402,"Reasoning:   1. First, we need to understand the relationship between the number of tailors, the time they work, and the number of dresses produced. The scenario suggests that each tailor works at the same rate, so we can assume that the number of dresses made is directly proportional to the number of tailors working and the time they spend working.  2. Let's denote the rate at which one tailor makes dresses as \(r\) dresses per hour. From the given information, 50 tailors working for 50 hours make 50 dresses. Therefore, the total work done by 50 tailors in 50 hours is \(50 \times r \times 50 = 50\) dresses.  3. Simplifying this equation, we get \(r = \frac{1}{25}\) dresses per hour per tailor. This means that one tailor makes \(\frac{1}{25}\) of a dress per hour.  4. Now, we want to know how long it will take 20 tailors to make 20 dresses. Using the same rate, the total work needed to make 20 dresses by 20 tailors would be \(20 \times r \times t = 20\), where \(t\) is the time in hours.  5. Substituting the value of \(r\) into the equation, we get \(20 \times \frac{1}{25} \times t = 20\). This simplifies to \(\frac{20}{25} \times t = 20\), which further simplifies to \(\frac{4}{5} \times t = 20\).  6. Solving for \(t\), we find \(t = \frac{20 \times 5}{4} = 25\) hours.

Now, consider the scenario involving 5 students and 5 exams:  - If we assume that the rate at which students complete exams is constant, then each student should still take the same amount of time to complete one exam, regardless of the total number of exams or students involved.    Since 7 students take 7 minutes to complete 7 exams, each student takes 7 minutes to complete one exam. Therefore, if there are only 5 students and they need to complete 5 exams, they would still collectively take the same amount of time as before because each exam is still being completed by one student.

Thus, it takes 2 machines 3 hours to make 2 smartphones.    Final Answer: 3 hours | 100","Reasoning: Let's start by analyzing the problem given.  1. **Understanding the initial condition**: The problem states that 3 machines can make 3 smartphones in 3 hours. This implies that the rate of production is such that 3 machines produce 1 smartphone per hour since \( \frac{3 \text{ smartphones}}{3 \text{ machines} \times 3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1 \text{ smartphone}}{3 \text{ machine-hours}} \).  2. **Determine the production rate per machine**: From the above, we know that 1 machine produces \( \frac{1}{3} \) of a smartphone per hour.  3. **Calculate the production time for 2 smartphones with 2 machines**: If 1 machine produces \( \frac{1}{3} \) of a smartphone per hour, then 2 machines would produce \( 2 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \) of a smartphone per hour. We need to find out how long it takes these 2 machines to produce 2 smartphones.   4. **Set up the equation for production time**:    - Let \( t \) be the time in hours needed for 2 machines to produce 2 smartphones.    - Since the combined production rate of 2 machines is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a smartphone per hour, the total production over time \( t \) is \( \frac{2}{3}t \).    - We want this total production to equal 2 smartphones, so we set up the equation: \( \frac{2}{3}t = 2 \).    - Solving for \( t \), we get \( t = 2 \times \frac{3}{2} = 3 \) hours.  Thus, it takes 2 machines 3 hours to make 2 smartphones.  Final Answer: 3 hours | 100",True

The problem gives us information about the number of opticians, the number of days they work, and the number of glasses they produce. This suggests we can use the concept of work rate to solve this.  2. First, let's determine the rate at which the opticians work. If 8 opticians take 8 days to make 8 glasses, then collectively, in one day, these 8 opticians make 1 glass. Therefore, the work rate of the 8 opticians together is 1 glass per 8 days.  3. To find the individual work rate, we divide the total work rate by the number of opticians: \( \frac{1 \text{ glass}}{8 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ opticians}} = \frac{1}{64} \text{ glasses per optician per day} \).  4. Now, we want to know how long it would take 7 opticians to make 7 glasses. Using the individual work rate, each optician can make \( \frac{1}{64} \) glasses per day. Therefore, 7 opticians working together can make \( 7 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{7}{64} \) glasses per day.  5. To find out how many days it takes for 7 opticians to make 7 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses needed by the number of glasses they can make per day: \( \frac{7 \text{ glasses}}{\frac{7}{64} \text{ glasses per day}} = 7 \times \frac{64}{7} = 64 \text{ days} \).

We can use the concept of work rate, which is how much work one person can do in a day.    1. First, let's calculate the total work done in terms of ""person-days."" If 8 people take 8 days to renovate 8 bathrooms, then the total amount of work done is \( 8 \text{ people} \times 8 \text{ days} = 64 \text{ person-days} \). This means that it takes 64 person-days to renovate 8 bathrooms.  2. The work rate per bathroom can be calculated by dividing the total person-days by the number of bathrooms.
