10,A pair of leggings and a body lotion together cost $54. The pair of leggings costs $50 more than the body lotion. How much does the body lotion cost?,[2],2.0,[100],6058,135,255,"Reasoning: Let's denote the cost of the body lotion by \(x\) dollars. Since the leggings cost $50 more than the body lotion, we can denote the cost of the leggings as \(x + 50\) dollars. According to the problem, the total cost of both items is $54.    So, we set up the equation based on the given information:  \[ x + (x + 50) = 54 \]    This simplifies to:  \[ 2x + 50 = 54 \]    Subtract 50 from both sides:  \[ 2x = 4 \]    Divide both sides by 2:  \[ x = 2 \]    Thus, the body lotion costs $2. To verify this, we substitute back to check:  - Cost of the body lotion: \(x = 2\)  - Cost of the leggings: \(x + 50 = 2 + 50 = 52\)    Adding these values should give us the total cost:  \[ 2 + 52 = 54 \]    This matches the total cost stated in the problem, confirming our solution is correct.
