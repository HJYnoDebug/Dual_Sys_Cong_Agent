Here's why:  * **We need to know the growth rate of the algae.** Algae growth is not linear. It likely follows an exponential pattern, meaning the rate of growth increases as more algae are present.   * **Exponential Growth:**  If algae growth doubles every day,  it would take 29 days for the tank to be 99% full, and then on day 30 it would be 100% full. This means that half the tank would be full on day 29.  **Without knowing the exact growth pattern of the algae, we can't determine the exact time it takes for half the tank to be filled.**  ## Final Answer:   We cannot determine the exact time. | 20     **Confidence Score:** 20% because the answer depends on the unknown algae growth rate.
