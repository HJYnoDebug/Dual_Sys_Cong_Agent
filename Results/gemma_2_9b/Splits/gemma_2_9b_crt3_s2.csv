47,"A forest is expanding on an island, with the area occupied by the trees doubling each year. If it takes 140 years for the entire island to be covered with trees, how many years would it take for the forest to cover half of the island?",139,139.0,100,1128,160,108,"    Reasoning:     1. **Understanding the Problem:** The forest grows at an exponential rate, doubling its area every year. We need to find the year before the island is fully covered when it's half covered.    2. **Working Backwards:** Since the forest doubles in size each year, if it covers the whole island in year 140, it must have covered half the island in year 139.    Final Answer: 139 | 100         ","  Reasoning:   1. **Understanding the Problem:** The forest grows at an exponential rate, doubling its area every year.

49,"People are walking into a theater and taking their seats. The number of people in the room multiplies by two every minute. If it takes 6 minutes for all of the seats to be taken, how long does it take for half of the seats to be taken?",5,5.0,100,1081,161,111,"    ## Reasoning:    1. **Understanding the Problem:** The core of the problem is that the number of people doubles every minute. This means we're dealing with exponential growth.    2. **Working Backwards:** Since the theater fills completely in 6 minutes, it must have been half full in the previous minute.    3. **Finding the Answer:**  If the theater is full at minute 6, it was half full at minute 5.       ## Final Answer: 5 | 100       ","  ## Reasoning:  1. **Understanding the Problem:** The core of the problem is that the number of people doubles every minute.

46,"A grandmother is knitting a scarf for her grandson. Each week, the scarf's length increases twofold. If it takes six weeks to complete the entire scarf, how long would it take to knit half of the scarf?",5,5.0,100,1276,151,141,"    ## Reasoning:    1. **Identify the Key Information:**      * The scarf doubles in length each week.      * It takes 6 weeks to complete the entire scarf.    2. **Work Backwards:**      * Since the scarf doubles in length each week, it means that in the 5th week, it was half the length of what it was in the 6th week.    3. **Conclusion:**      * Therefore, it would take **5 weeks** to knit half of the scarf.    ## Final Answer: 5 | 100       Let me know if you'd like to explore any other logic puzzles!

43,"During winter, snowfall is occurring and the depth of the snow cover doubles every hour. If it takes 10 hours for the snow depth to reach 2 meters, how much time is required for it to reach a depth of 1 meter?",9 hours,9.0,100%,1587,157,196,"    ## Reasoning:    1. **Understanding the Problem:**  Snow depth doubles every hour. This means if it's X meters at one hour, it will be 2X meters at the next hour.    2. **Working Backwards:** We know the snow depth is 2 meters after 10 hours.  To find the depth at 9 hours, we divide by 2: 2 meters / 2 = 1 meter.    3. **Conclusion:**  Therefore, it took **9 hours** for the snow depth to reach 1 meter.    Final Answer: 9 hours | 100%        ## Beta Review:    The reasoning used is logically sound and avoids common biases like anchoring (getting fixated on the final depth) or confirmation bias (looking for information that confirms a pre-existing assumption).     The solution effectively utilizes the given information and works backward to find the desired time.       ","  ## Reasoning:  1. **Understanding the Problem:**  Snow depth doubles every hour.
