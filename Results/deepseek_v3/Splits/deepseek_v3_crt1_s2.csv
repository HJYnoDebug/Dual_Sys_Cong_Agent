29,A hat and a coffee table together cost $1.20. The hat costs $1 more than the coffee table. How much does the coffee table cost?,[$0.10],0.1,[Confidence Score: 100],17658,119,690,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to think aloud as I work through it to make sure I understand everything correctly.    ### Understanding the Problem    We have two items:  1. A hat  2. A coffee table    Together, they cost $1.20. That means:  \[ \text{Hat} + \text{Coffee Table} = \$1.20 \]    The second piece of information is that the hat costs $1 more than the coffee table. So:  \[ \text{Hat} = \text{Coffee Table} + \$1 \]    Our goal is to find out how much the coffee table costs.    ### Setting Up the Equations    From the information above, we can write two equations:  1. \( H + C = 1.20 \)  (where \( H \) is the price of the hat, \( C \) is the price of the coffee table)  2. \( H = C + 1 \)    Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one. That means wherever we see \( H \) in the first equation, we can replace it with \( C + 1 \).    So, substituting:  \[ (C + 1) + C = 1.20 \]    ### Solving for \( C \)    Now, let's simplify the equation:  \[ C + 1 + C = 1.20 \]  \[ 2C + 1 = 1.20 \]    Next, subtract 1 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( C \):  \[ 2C = 1.20 - 1 \]  \[ 2C = 0.20 \]    Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( C \):  \[ C = \frac{0.20}{2} \]  \[ C = 0.10 \]    So, the coffee table costs $0.10.    ### Verifying the Solution    Let's check if this makes sense. If the coffee table is $0.10, then the hat, which is $1 more, would be:  \[ H = C + 1 \]  \[ H = 0.10 + 1 \]  \[ H = 1.10 \]    Now, let's add them together to see if they total $1.20:  \[ H + C = 1.10 + 0.10 = 1.20 \]    This checks out! The total is indeed $1.20, and the hat is $1 more than the coffee table.    ### Initial Intuitive Mistake    At first glance, one might be tempted to think that if the hat is $1 more than the coffee table, and together they're $1.20, then the coffee table is $0.20 and the hat is $1.20 - $0.20 = $1.00. But then the hat would only be $0.80 more than the coffee table ($1.00 - $0.20 = $0.80), not $1.00 more. That doesn't satisfy the second condition.     This is why setting up the equations properly is crucial to avoid such intuitive errors.    ### Final Answer    After carefully working through the problem and verifying the solution, the cost of the coffee table is:    Final Answer: [$0.10] | [Confidence Score: 100]","Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step.

Final Answer: [$1] | [100]","Reasoning: Let's denote the cost of the scarf as \( S \) and the cost of the leggings as \( L \). We are given two pieces of information:  1. The total cost of the leggings and the scarf is $52:    \[    L + S = 52 \quad (1)    \] 2. The leggings cost $50 more than the scarf:    \[    L = S + 50 \quad (2)    \]  Now, we can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to solve for \( S \): \[ (S + 50) + S = 52 \] Combine like terms: \[ 2S + 50 = 52 \] Subtract 50 from both sides: \[ 2S = 2 \] Divide both sides by 2: \[ S = 1 \]  Thus, the scarf costs $1. To verify, we can check if the leggings cost $50 more than the scarf: \[ L = S + 50 = 1 + 50 = 51 \] Adding the costs: \[ L + S = 51 + 1 = 52 \] This matches the total cost given in the problem.
