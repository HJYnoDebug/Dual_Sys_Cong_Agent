Substituting equation 2 into equation 1:    C + (C + 50) = 52 → 2C + 50 = 52 → 2C = 2 → **C = 1**.    Thus, the camera costs **$1** and the wallet costs **$51**.      Verification:    - Total cost: 1 + 51 = 52 ✔️    - Wallet is $50 more than the camera: 51 - 1 = 50 ✔️      A common intuitive error is to assume the camera costs $2 (52 - 50), but this ignores the fact that the wallet’s $50 premium must be added *after* the camera’s price, leading to a total of $54. The correct approach avoids this by explicitly modeling the relationship between the two variables.

34,A bottle of bath salts and a pack of diapers together cost $510. The bottle of bath salts costs $500 more than the pack of diapers. How much does the pack of diapers cost?,[5],5.0,[100],16416,146,337,"Reasoning (Alpha Phase):    Let's define the variables for the problem.    Let the cost of the pack of diapers be denoted by $ D $ (in dollars).    According to the problem, the bottle of bath salts costs $500 more than the pack of diapers. Therefore, the cost of the bottle of bath salts is $ D + 500 $.    The total cost of the pack of diapers and the bottle of bath salts together is $510. This gives us the equation:  $$ D + (D + 500) = 510 $$    Now, let's simplify and solve this equation step by step:    1. Combine like terms:  $$ 2D + 500 = 510 $$    2. Subtract 500 from both sides to isolate the term with $ D $:  $$ 2D = 10 $$    3. Divide both sides by 2 to find $ D $:  $$ D = 5 $$    So, the pack of diapers costs $5.    Now, for the Beta Phase (Review):    Let’s verify the solution to ensure it is accurate and free from logical errors:    - If the pack of diapers costs $5, then the bottle of bath salts costs $5 + $500 = $505.  - The total cost is $5 + $505 = $510, which matches the problem's description.  - The logic and arithmetic are correct.  - There are no intuitive biases or logical traps in the reasoning.

37,A pair of sunglasses and a toy together cost $13. The pair of sunglasses costs $10 more than the toy. How much does the toy cost?,[The toy costs $1.50],1.5,[100],15878,136,336,"Reasoning:    Let's denote the cost of the toy as T (in dollars).    According to the problem, the cost of the sunglasses is $10 more than the toy, so the cost of the sunglasses is T + $10.    The total cost of the sunglasses and the toy is given as $13.    Therefore, we can write the equation:    T + (T + 10) = 13    Simplify the equation:    2T + 10 = 13    Subtract 10 from both sides:    2T = 3    Divide both sides by 2:    T = 1.5    So, the toy costs $1.50.    Now, let's verify the solution.    If the toy costs $1.50, then the sunglasses cost $1.50 + $10 = $11.50.    The total cost is $1.50 + $11.50 = $13, which matches the information in the problem.

46,A keyboard and a pair of socks together cost $54. The keyboard costs $50 more than the pair of socks. How much does the pair of socks cost?,$2,2.0,100,28394,135,582,"Reasoning: Let the cost of the socks be S. The keyboard costs $50 more than the socks, so Keyboard = S + $50. Together, they sum to $54: S + (S + 50) = 54 → 2S + 50 = 54 → 2S = 4 → S = $2. Verification: Socks = $2, Keyboard = $52 (2 + 50). Total = 2 + 52 = $54, satisfying all conditions.

41,A pair of sunglasses and a light bulb together cost $130. The pair of sunglasses costs $100 more than the light bulb. How much does the light bulb cost?,$15,15.0,100,38855,138,894,"Reasoning: Let the cost of the light bulb be L dollars. The sunglasses cost L + $100. Together, they sum to $130:    L + (L + 100) = 130 → 2L + 100 = 130 → 2L = 30 → L = 15.    Verification: Light bulb = $15, sunglasses = $115. Total = $130, and $115 - $15 = $100 (matches the condition).    The intuitive bias here is assuming the bulb costs $30 (130 - 100), but this ignores that the $100 difference is added to the bulb’s cost, requiring solving for two instances of the bulb’s price.

47,A set of wine glasses and a pizza together cost $53. The set of wine glasses costs $50 more than the pizza. How much does the pizza cost?,$1.50,1.5,95,32164,135,693,"Reasoning: Let the pizza cost $P. The wine glasses cost $P + $50. The total cost is $53, so P + (P + 50) = 53. Solving gives 2P = 3 → P = $1.50. Verification: Pizza = $1.50, wine glasses = $51.50; total = $53. The logic holds as the wine glasses are $50 more than the pizza, and the sum matches. Intuitive traps may arise from misinterpreting ""more than"" as a total difference rather than a direct comparison between the two items.

44,A wall clock and a light bulb together cost $1.30. The wall clock costs $1 more than the light bulb. How much does the light bulb cost?,[The light bulb costs $0.15],0.15,[10,43206,135,1024,"Reasoning: The problem states that a wall clock and a light bulb together cost $1.30, with the clock being $1 more expensive. Assigning the bulb's cost as $x, the clock costs $x + $1. The equation becomes:    $x + (x + 1) = 1.30$    Simplifying: $2x + 1 = 1.30$ → $2x = 0.30$ → $x = 0.15$.      Verification:    - Bulb: $0.15    - Clock: $1.15    - Total: $0.15 + $1.15 = $1.30.      This aligns with the problem's constraints. Intuitive traps (e.g., guessing $0.10) are resolved by algebraic rigor and verification.
