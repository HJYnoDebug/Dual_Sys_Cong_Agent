1,"A pandemic is occurring in a state where the total number of infected individuals doubles daily. If it takes 10 days for the entire state's population to become infected, how many days would it take for half of the state's population to be infected?",9,9.0,100,5022,154,343,"Reasoning:    We are told that the total number of infected individuals in a state doubles every day, and that it takes 10 days for the entire population to become infected. The question asks: how many days would it take for half the state's population to be infected?      Let’s consider the nature of exponential growth. If the number of infected individuals doubles each day, then the infection rate follows a pattern like this:    On day 1, there are X infected individuals.    On day 2, there are 2X infected individuals.    On day 3, there are 4X infected individuals.    ...    On day N, the number of infected individuals is $ 2^{N-1} \cdot X $.    Since the population is fully infected on day 10, the number of infected individuals on day 10 must equal the total population. That means on day 9, the number of infected individuals would have been half the total population (because on day 10, it doubles from day 9 to reach the full population).      Thus, for half the state's population to be infected, it would take 9 days, not 5 days (which would be true for linear growth).      This is a classic example of exponential growth, where the time to reach a certain fraction is not proportional to the time to reach the full amount. Instead, the last doubling always brings the number from half to full. So the key insight is: **If the total population is infected on day 10 due to doubling, then half the population must have been infected on day 9.**    Final Answer: 9 | 100","Reasoning:   We are told that the total number of infected individuals in a state doubles every day, and that it takes 10 days for the entire population to become infected.

7,"A fly is traveling from point A to point B. With each passing hour, the total distance it covered doubles. If the fly reaches point B in 12 hours, how long does it take for the fly to cover half of the distance?",11 hours,11.0,100,5959,153,408,"Reasoning:     Let's define the problem systematically.     - The fly is traveling from point A to point B.  - Every hour, the total distance it has covered **doubles**.  - It reaches point B in 12 hours.  - We are asked to find how long it takes to cover **half the distance** to point B.    This is an interesting case of exponential growth. If the total distance the fly has covered doubles every hour, then at 12 hours, it has completed the full distance to point B. Let's denote the full distance as $ D $. Since the distance doubles every hour, the distance covered at any hour $ t $ is $ D_t = D_{t-1} \times 2 $.    We are told that at hour 12, the fly reaches point B, i.e., $ D_{12} = D $. Since the distance doubles every hour, this implies that just **one hour before** reaching point B (at hour 11), the fly had only covered **half the total distance**, because doubling that amount at hour 12 would get it to the full distance.    Thus, the time it takes for the fly to cover half the distance is **11 hours**.    Now let's review this reasoning using the Beta phase:    - The problem is a classic exponential growth question. The key is to understand that doubling every hour means the fly's progress is not linear but rather logarithmic in nature.  - There is a risk of intuitive bias here, where one might assume the fly progresses linearly and divide the time by 2 (e.g., 6 hours). That would be incorrect.  - The correct approach is to reverse engineer from the final hour because exponential growth implies that the last doubling brings the fly to the full distance, and the previous one is exactly half.  - Hence, the reasoning in the Alpha phase is sound, and no logical errors or biases are evident.

11,"There is a section of mold on a bread loaf that doubles in size every hour.

If the entire population evacuates in 22 days, then on day 22, the total count is double that of day 21. This means day 21’s total is exactly half of day 22’s.

Thus, at 7 hours, the factory would have filled half the bags. This is analogous to the lily pad problem, where the last doubling period accounts for half the total. No logical traps here; the exponential nature is key.  Final Answer: 7 | 100",True
